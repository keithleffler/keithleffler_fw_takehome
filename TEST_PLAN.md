## Tasks

There appears to be no validation on cost or 
## Forms

There is no time validation between date/time columns on a form.  I noticed this on the equipment 
of the Daily Status form and confirmed in the form designer.  Adding time validation between columns would 
add complexity to the form designer but could eliminate reporting errors if reports aggregate total time.
